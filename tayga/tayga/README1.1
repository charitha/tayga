Stateful NAT64
-------------------------------


Most people are familiar with stateful NAT, which allows N:1 address mapping
by tracking TCP and UDP sessions and rewriting port numbers on each packet.
Most commonly this is used to translate sessions from multiple "internal"
hosts (which are numbered with private IPv4 addresses) onto a single global
IPv4 address on the NAT device's "external" interface.


----------------------------------
Installation & Basic Configuration
----------------------------------
TAYGA uses the GNU Automake/Autoconf system, which requires the `configure`

run:

  # ./configure && make && make install

This will install the tayga executable in /usr/local/sbin/tayga and the sample
Now create your site-specific tayga.conf configuration file.

config file in /usr/local/etc/tayga.conf.example.

have the configuration file in
/usr/local/etc/tayga.conf

Next, if you would like dynamic maps to be persistent between TAYGA restarts,
create a directory to store the dynamic.map file:

  # mkdir -p /var/db/tayga

Before starting the TAYGA daemon, the routing setup on your system will need
to be changed to send IPv4 and IPv6 packets to TAYGA.  First create the TUN
network interface:

All Run configuration present in script start.sh 

run:
   sudo sh start.sh
